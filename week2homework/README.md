## I am starting a new caareer in a new field. The last few years burned me out in healthcare so I need something completely different. My other jobs all involved customer service so I prefer something with linited contact with the general public. Since I have been a creative person all my life, wev development seemed like a good fit. To enter this new areana, I would like to achieve the following...
- Better understanding of how computers function and how to speak to them.
- Better job.
- The ability to converse intellegently about coding.
- To improve my ability to adjust a new system to my personal or professional needs.
- Increase personal income.
