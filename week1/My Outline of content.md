## This application will allow dogs to play and socialize and get exercise while their humans are doing the same thing.

# **Real World problem that is being solved**
### -Dogs left alone can get bored tearing up household items and structures.
### -Dogs who are left alone can become depressed leading to health issues not unlike those humans suffer when depressed and lonely.
### -Most dogs have limited contact with others of their species.
### -Gyms suffered a loss of membership during covid because more people started working out at home. This would encourage them to rejoin.
### -Pet owners who work out at home have difficulty doing a downward dog while their actual dog is licking their faces or jumping on their backs.
### -There are pet owners who don't go to the gym because they feel guilty socializing and exercising while the dog sits by the window howling for them to come back.

# **Style**
 ### -Primary colors will be used throughout since the program will eventually house child care options as well. This will emphasize the family aspect of the site.
 ### -Images will be of dogs owned by my family, dogs socializing with each other, people with their dogs. As the site expands, similar pictures of children and families will be added.
 ### -Font will be Robot Slab for the app and company names. The simplier version of Roboto will be used for the text. The clean lines of the text support the simplicity of site navigation.
 ### -The company logo will be a dog on a treadmill - if I can find one that does not have a copy write.
 ### -Touch or point and click navigation using a dog bone as a curser.
