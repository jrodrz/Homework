  <h1>21st Century Spirituality</h1>
    <para>Traditional religions are on the decline. Humans, though, have spirit and are drawn to spiritual persuits and practices. So what has replaced traditional religion in fullfilling this need? The late 20th century saw a rise in something, then called "New Ageism". This is an approach to spiritality that relies not on traditional ritual and conformity, but rather individual inklings. It speaks to the needs of the individual and encourages them to follow their own spiritual guides to explore their uniqueness in the universe. Beginning in the 1970's, these practices that had fallen out of favor and been suppressed by Catholicism, began to catch on with young people. Now they are common place in cities and suburbs throughout the country. Many of them had been in constant practice outside of the U.S.</para>
